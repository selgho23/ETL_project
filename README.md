# Transportation in California

## Project Summary
- Two datasets were pulled from [CHHS Open Data](https://data.chhs.ca.gov/).
    - [Transportation to Work](https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/transportation-to-work-2000-2006-2010/resource/fc5eafc8-0648-4a30-9bf5-e06f09e8320d)
    - [Road Traffic Injuries](https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/road-traffic-injuries-2002-2010/resource/cdb50347-6fe1-456e-a336-d7daf0aba595)

- After exploring the datasets, we filtered out extraneous data, organized what remained into category specific tables, and cleaned relevant columns.

- The tables were loaded into a database  with the following schema.
